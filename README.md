# joint.py

Module that defines a mechanical joint components and its dimensional/physical params in order to compute fastener and clamped parts failure modes.

The mechanical enginnering theory behind this modules is based on the European Space Agency (ESA) "Space Engineering, Threaded Fasteners Handbook" (ECSS-E-HB-32-23A, 16 April 2010)

The goal is to provide the mechanical engineer with a tool to perform traceable, reliable threaded fasteners analysis in matter of minutes. The tool could be expanded to become the back-end for GUI based software

# DISCLAMER
The module is currently under development and it is not validated; 
Margin of Safety obtained through this tool are to be considered wrong.
Provided material parameters are meant to validate the code; they are dummy values.
The tool is published on github in order to look for possible collaboration and help during the development process
